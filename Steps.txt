We make the VS Code new Repo
Then we init he it in the folder

1. git Repo
2. create folder for buildin project
3. go inside and open it in and clone it in VS code
4. create virtual env using conda
        conda create -p venv python3.12 -y -------- -p = full path -----  -y = yes to all ---- -n = requried or custome name path
        conda acivate 
        conda deactivate 

5. make the setup.py file 
        from setuptools import find_packages, ## name it setup

        setup(
            name = "Project name",
            author = "author_name",
            author_email = "email",
            packages = find_packages()

        )         

6. make the requrinments.txt file 
        we can add all the requried files that we need in our project 
                pip install -r requrinments ------------  -r = flag -- it will read the all packages one by one  

                we can make function to set in setup.py file with name install_requires = ["pandas","  ","  " ]
